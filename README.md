# VTOL-Board

The board and firmware for the EG-310 VTOL project.


## Instructions to include this in your own project repo

I recommend using git submodules, add this to your tree like this

```shell
cd my_project
git submodule add https://github.com/KenwoodFox/VTOL-Board
git add -A
git commit -m "Added VTOL board
```
